## What's this repo?
This is a reposity for keeping open sourced code from Hexolus, one of my ongoing Roblox projects. \
I've decided to start open sourcing certain well-polished, more finished aspects of my game. This will include much of Hexolus' most fundamental code in the future. \
The game itself will not ever be open source, however, many of the tools I develop that make the game function will be completetely free to use by any developer who finds them useful.

# Anticheat
Hexolus' Anticheat was developed based on one of my older devforum articles: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/how-you-should-secure-your-game-a-beginner-guide-for-secure-networking-and-developing-anticheats/351775 \
The anticheat has been fine tuned to prevent most movement exploits from the server alone, with no help from any client-sided code. This makes the anticheat virtually impossible to defeat in many aspects.
